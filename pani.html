	<h2>Example of essay writing</h2>
	<p>These days, there is an ongoing debate between people about older people, whether they are the responsibility of their family members or the nation. While it is possible to claim that it is the duty of government to look after their citizen, my view is that when person grows old they are supposed to stay with their family. In this essay, I shall explain my point of view by analyzing both sides of argument.</p>
	<p> On the one hand, critics may point out that senior citizens worked their entire life for their country.</p> 
	<p>Another key fact to remember, the tax they paid to their country from their hard earned money. In return they should be looked by the country when they are old and no more able to work to earn their living. According to the survey done by the students of Trinity college, they found out that nine out of ten senior citizen are left alone at home while, other family members are at work. Hence they do not get proper care.
On the other hand, some experts  would argue that,</p> <p>senior citizen should be with their family rather than some old house for elderly people. President of senior citizen club,professor Jack on the day of first general meeting he  stated that, many old citizen preferred to stay with their family rather than some house provided by the government of their country. As they get all love and support from their family members till their last breathe. </p>
